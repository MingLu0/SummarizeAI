# How to Export to Cursor for Android Development

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Download the Design Spec
Download the `DESIGN_SPEC.md` file from this project. This contains everything needed to recreate the UI in Jetpack Compose.

### Step 2: Take Screenshots (Optional but Recommended)
While viewing this Figma Make project:
1. Take screenshots of each screen for visual reference
2. Save them in a folder called `design-reference/`
3. Name them clearly: `welcome-screen.png`, `home-screen.png`, etc.

### Step 3: Open Cursor
1. Open Cursor IDE on your computer
2. Create a new Android project or open existing one

### Step 4: Share with Cursor AI
In Cursor, open the AI chat and provide:

```
I need to build a native Android app using Jetpack Compose based on this design specification. 
The app is called "Summarize AI" - a text summarization app with a clean, modern UI.

[Paste or attach the DESIGN_SPEC.md content here]

Please help me:
1. Setup the project structure
2. Create the design system (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Implement each screen as Composable functions
4. Setup navigation between screens
5. Add the bottom tab navigation

Start with the project setup and design system.
```

### Step 5: Iterative Implementation
Work with Cursor to implement each screen one at a time:

1. **First:** Design system and theme
2. **Second:** Welcome screen
3. **Third:** Main navigation structure with bottom tabs
4. **Fourth:** Home/Input screen
5. **Fifth:** Loading screen
6. **Sixth:** Output screen
7. **Seventh:** History screen
8. **Eighth:** Saved screen
9. **Ninth:** Settings screen

### Step 6: Add Screenshots (If Available)
If you took screenshots, share them with Cursor:
```
Here's what the [screen name] should look like visually:
[Attach screenshot]

Please implement this screen matching the design exactly.
```

## üéØ Alternative: Direct Copy-Paste Approach

If you want to give Cursor everything at once:

### Create a New Chat in Cursor
```
I'm building a native Android app called "Summarize AI" using Jetpack Compose. 

This is a text summarization app with 7 screens:
1. Welcome/Onboarding
2. Home (Input)
3. Loading
4. Output (Summary display)
5. History
6. Saved items
7. Settings

The app uses a bottom tab navigation for Home, History, Saved, and Settings.

I have a complete design specification. Let me share it with you:

[Paste entire DESIGN_SPEC.md content]

Please help me build this app step by step. Let's start with:
1. Creating the Android project structure
2. Setting up the design system (Theme.kt)
3. Creating the bottom navigation structure

After that, we'll implement each screen one by one.
```

## üîó Files to Share with Cursor

Essential files:
1. ‚úÖ **DESIGN_SPEC.md** - Complete design documentation
2. ‚≠ê **Screenshots/** - Visual references (highly recommended)

Optional files (if Cursor asks for React reference):
3. All `.tsx` files from `/components/` folder
4. The `/styles/globals.css` file

---

## üöÄ Expected Timeline

With Cursor AI assistance:
- **Design System Setup:** 30 minutes
- **Navigation Structure:** 30 minutes  
- **Each Screen Implementation:** 45-60 minutes
- **Polish & Refinement:** 2-3 hours

**Total:** ~8-10 hours for complete implementation

## üí™ Pro Tips

1. **One screen at a time:** Don't try to implement everything at once
2. **Test frequently:** Build and run after each screen
3. **Use previews:** Leverage `@Preview` annotations in Compose
4. **Reference screenshots:** Visual reference is faster than reading specs
5. **Ask Cursor to explain:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification
6. **Iterate:** First get it working, then make it pixel-perfect
